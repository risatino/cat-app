# Learning Markdown 

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running. However, in this application, it is for learning markdown and getting better at stylizing documentation.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version 2.4.1

* System dependencies - gems in gemfile

* Database creation -- postgres database (**currently conflicts**)

* Database initialization -- postgres database (**currently conflicts**)
